This version contains IEEE 802.11ac mandatory features.
1) Up to 80 MHz tx/rx
2) Multiple streams (MMSE receiver)
3) A-MPDU

Others:
1) minstrel_ht
2) Caudal loss modeling
3) Second capture effect
4) CCA sensitivity modification (based on standard document)

Bug fix report:
1) Second capture bug - handling packet pointer that will be ignored
2) RTS/CTS duration bug - do not change PHY rate after RTS/CTS exchange
3) RTS/CTS preamble bug - when using BlockAckReq, do not use legacy only preamble since BlockAckReq will be sent 11n/ac PHY rate
