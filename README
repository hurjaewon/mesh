NS-3.21 extension
Latest update: 2016-11-03

This version contains IEEE 802.11ac mandatory features.
1) Up to 80 MHz tx/rx
2) Multiple streams (MMSE receiver)
3) A-MPDU
4) TXOP
5) Caudal loss

Others:
1) minstrel_ht
2) Caudal loss modeling
3) Second capture effect
4) CCA sensitivity modification (based on standard document)

Bug fix report:
1) 150825 Second capture bug (handling packet pointer that will be ignored)
2) 150825 RTS/CTS duration bug (do not change PHY rate after RTS/CTS exchange)
3) 150825 BlockAckReq preamble bug (when using BlockAckReq, do not use legacy only preamble since BlockAckReq will be sent 11n/ac PHY rate)
4) 150910 MIMO SNR bug (MMSE filter input channel variance should be 1)
5) 160328 TXOP implementation
6) 160328 BlockAck Sequence bug
7) 161103 Remove STRALE/MoFA from the code
8) 161103 Second capture bug (When second capture occurs, each MPDU should be dropped (not the whole A-MPDU)
9) 161103 Minstrel bug (RTS/CTS should not be included in statistics)
10) 161103 Interference power also used for CCA and capture decision bug fix (interference power -> pathloss + fading)
11) 161103 CCA bug (When a station does not receive legacy preamble, EDCCA is required)

To do list:
1) EDCCA should be used after L-SIG error (carrier lost)
2) Interference power calculation for 80 MHz and multiple streams
