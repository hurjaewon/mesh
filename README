NS-3.21 extension
Latest update: 2017-10-30

This version contains IEEE 802.11ac mandatory features.
1) Up to 80 MHz tx/rx
2) Multiple streams (MMSE receiver)
3) A-MPDU
4) TXOP
5) Caudal loss

Others:
1) minstrel_ht
2) Caudal loss modeling
3) Second capture effect
4) CCA sensitivity modification (based on standard document)

Bug fix report:
1) 150825 Second capture bug (handling packet pointer that will be ignored)
2) 150825 RTS/CTS duration bug (do not change PHY rate after RTS/CTS exchange)
3) 150825 BlockAckReq preamble bug (use HT/VHT preamble since BlockAckReq will be sent 11n/ac PHY rate)
4) 150910 MIMO SNR bug (MMSE filter input channel variance should be 1)
5) 160328 TXOP implementation
6) 160328 BlockAck Sequence bug
7) 161103 Remove STRALE/MoFA from the code
8) 161103 Second capture bug (When second capture occurs, each MPDU should be dropped)
9) 161103 Minstrel bug (RTS/CTS should not be included in statistics)
10) 161103 Interference power also used for CCA and capture decision bug (pathloss + fading)
11) 161103 CCA bug (When a station does not receive legacy preamble, EDCCA is required)
12) 171030 Bug when receiving second captured A-MPDU
13) 171030 Minstrel HT bug
14) 171030 Disable ErrorFreeTag on ACK frame
15) 171030 CCA sensitivity with wide band operation (-72 dBm) in YansWifiPhy-StartReceivePacket
16) 171030 Symmetric channel fading gain
17) 171031 CCA sensitivity in MaybeCCABusy of YansWifiPhy-StartReceivePacket (shall not be normalized by used bandwidth)
18) 171102 CCA sensitivity in MaybeCCABusy of YansWifiPhy-StartReceivePacket (-62 for P20 and -72 for S20 & S40, respectively)
19) 171102 NoiseFloor normalized for 20 MHz in CalculateSnr of InterferenceHelper
20) 171102 Fading gain & wide bandwidth consideration in CalculatePer of InterferenceHelper (for non A-MPDU)
21) 171102 Subframe length, PHY header PER & duration modified in CalculateAmpduPer of InterferenceHelper (for A-MPDU)

To do list:
1) EDCCA should be used after L-SIG error (carrier lost)
2) Channel correlation across bonding channel
3) Interference power calculation for multiple streams considering # rx antennas
4) Data rate using long G.I for VHT PPDU
